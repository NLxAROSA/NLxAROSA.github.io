## A New Beginning

<img align="left" src="/img/newdawn.png" width="25%"/>It was long overdue, but it's finally here. The latest iteration of 'Deploy on Friday!' is live! And setting up a blog in 2024 is so easy, it's literally just minutes, and I'll explain in a following post. ;)

The blog still needs some tweaking and tuning, but I've got quite a few topics and posts in the pipeline. Not just about deployment and resilience best practices, but any other developer related topic that crosses my path. No AI will be harmed in making this content, it's all by yours truly!
